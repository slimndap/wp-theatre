#Theater for WordPress
An amazing project

## Events vs. productions

Theater for WordPress uses _productions_ to group your _events_. Each production can have one or more events.

So if you run a theatre then 'The Sound Of Music' is a _production_ and the show this weekend is an _event_.

## Website owners
